#  Advanced Implementation of the A* Pathfinding Algorithm with Heuristic Analysis

This project provides a complete implementation of the **A*** search algorithm on a weighted 2D grid, along with a comparative performance analysis of **Manhattan** and **Euclidean** heuristics.  
The goal is to study how heuristic selection impacts path optimality, nodes expanded, execution time, and search efficiency.

##  Project Overview

This project fulfills all the tasks outlined in the “Advanced Implementation of the A* Pathfinding Algorithm with Heuristic Analysis” assignment.

The implementation compares two admissible heuristics:

- **Manhattan Distance**
- **Euclidean Distance**

Both produce the same optimal path cost but differ in node expansions and execution time.

##  Tasks Completed

### **1. Grid/Graph Data Structure**
Implemented in `src/graph.py`  
Features:
- Weighted grid  
- Obstacles  
- Random map generator  
- Neighbor lookup  

---

### **2. A* Search Algorithm**
Implemented in `src/astar.py`  
Includes:
- Priority Queue  
- g-cost tracking  
- f-cost computation  
- Path reconstruction  
- Node expansion count  
- Execution time  

---

### **3. Two Admissible Heuristics**
Implemented in `src/heuristics.py`:
- Manhattan (L1)
- Euclidean (L2)

---

### **4. Testing Harness — 10 Experiments**
Implemented in `src/tester.py`  
Each test:
- Generates a solvable grid  
- Runs both heuristics  
- Records:
  - path_length  
  - total_cost  
  - nodes_expanded  
  - execution_time_ms  

---

### **5. Raw Log Output**
Saved in:  
```
data/astar_raw_log.txt
```
Contains detailed results for all 20 runs (10 × 2 heuristics).

---

##  Summary of Experimental Results

### **Manhattan Heuristic**
- Fewer nodes expanded in most cases  
- More consistent in dense environments  

### **Euclidean Heuristic**
- Same optimal cost as Manhattan  
- Occasionally faster  
- Slightly higher node expansions
